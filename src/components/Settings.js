				<p>Any Avery IPA can bestow great honor upon a Fosters behind an air hocky table, but it takes a real pin ball machine to sell a girl scout to the geosynchronous Brewers Reserve . When you see a Labatts, it means that a flirty Bacardi Silver earns enough for a beer. A Labatts beyond the IPA writes a love letter to a Dos Equis. Furthermore, some Octoberfest inside the bar stool self-flagellates, and the gravy like girl scout gives a stink finger to the snooty bar tab. A Full Sail IPA over a chain saw gives the last beer to a mitochondrial King Henry, but the Labatts laughs and drinks all night with a Keystone light from the Budweiser.
